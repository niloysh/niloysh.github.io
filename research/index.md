### Current Work (2019-Present)
I am currently exploring programmable networks, network virtualization (NFV), their performance,
and their interplay in the context of 5G and IoT. In NFV, decomposing network functions into modular elements that can be re-used across multiple applications could help in addressing some crucial challenges of IoT, such as scalability and heterogeneity. Programmable data planes offer the ability to forward
packets based on arbitrary frame formats and could be used to support operations such as
in-network data processing, both of which can advantageous for IoT. The great variety of use-cases in IoT necessitate different service-function-chains for subsets of traffic, while maintaining satisfactory isolation among them to deal with sensitive data (applications such as healthcare and security). A fine-grained programming model for network-wide data plane programmability could be used to address the requirements of IoT applications.

### MS thesis (2016-2018)
*QoS-Aware Software-Defined Networks for IoT Applications* <br>
Advisor: [Dr. Sudip Misra](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~smisra/index.html)

Software-defined networking (SDN) is a paradigm shift from traditional networking which increases network flexibility and ease of management by introducing network abstractions for the control plane. This [video](https://youtu.be/WabdXYzCAOU) serves a good introduction to SDN. The emerging internet of things (IoT) paradigm envisions a ubiquitous network of *smart* objects, such as radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, wireless sensors/actuators, and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication devices across a varied range of communication technologies, capabilities, and requirements. I study how a software-defined architecture can help in addressing the challenges in IoT. Specifically, I explore issues such as quality of service (QoS), traffic-engineering and mobility management.
