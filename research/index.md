### MS thesis (2016-Present)
*QoS-Aware Software-Defined Networks for IoT Applications* <br>
Advisor: [Dr. Sudip Misra](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~smisra/index.html)

Software-defined networking (SDN) is a paradigm shift from traditional networking which increases network flexibility and ease of management by introducing network abstractions for the control plane. This [video](https://youtu.be/WabdXYzCAOU) serves a good introduction to SDN. The emerging internet of things (IoT) paradigm envisions a ubiquitous network of *smart* objects, such as radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, wireless sensors/actuators, and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication devices across a varied range of communication technologies, capabilities, and requirements. I study how a software-defined architecture can help in addressing the challenges in IoT. Specifically, I explore issues such as quality of service (QoS), traffic-engineering and mobility management.
